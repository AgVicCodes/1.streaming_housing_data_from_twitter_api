"@chu_chu_ezekwem I know someone in London. His rent alone is 1,800. Assuming he earns 3,500 after tax . He will be left with 1,700. From 1,700, you will deduct council tax, water bill, Energy bill, car insurance, groceries shopping, fuel. The person won’t even have 500 to save.",ONYEDIKACHUKWU ANAMBRA,Sat Feb 10 20:18:52 +0000 2024
