"The average graduate salary in London is Â£31,257.

After the increase of NI, tax and student loan repayment, youâ€™re left with Â£2,013.11 per month.

The average rent for new tenancies is Â£1,572.

So that leaves Â£441.11 for council tax, energy bills, water, groceries, etc.????",Sadiq,Thu Feb 03 14:59:33 +0000 2022
